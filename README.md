# 🤖 Hands-Free Escort Robot

A ROS 2 project where a TurtleBot3 robot navigates and follows human commands (keyboard or future voice control) in a Gazebo world. Built using ROS 2 Jazzy, this project is beginner-friendly and simulates an escort robot for use in shopping malls, airports, and hospitals.

## 🚀 Features

- TurtleBot3 Simulation in Gazebo
- Keyboard-based teleoperation (`/cmd_vel`)
- ROS 2 workspace with structured package
- Future plan: Add voice control using `speech_recognition` + `ros2 topic pub`
